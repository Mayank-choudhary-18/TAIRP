# TECH A INTERN PROJECTS 

Description
This project contains the following modules:

Credit Card Validator
Document Scanner
Face Detection
Guessing Number
Location Finder
Voice to Text Converter


Credit Card Validator: Credit card validation is an important task in e-commerce and online transactions. By learning how to validate credit card numbers using the Luhn algorithm, you can build more secure payment systems and prevent fraudulent transactions.

Document Scanner: Document scanning is a common task in many industries, such as healthcare, finance, and legal. By learning how to use computer vision techniques to extract documents from images, you can automate document processing tasks and improve efficiency.

Face Detection: Face detection is a key component of many computer vision applications, such as security systems, surveillance, and image search. By learning how to use machine learning algorithms to detect faces in images or video streams, you can build more intelligent and responsive systems.

Guessing Number: Number guessing games are a fun way to learn programming concepts such as loops, conditional statements, and random number generation. By building your own number guessing game, you can improve your problem-solving skills and learn how to create interactive applications.

Location Finder: Location-based services are becoming increasingly popular in many industries, such as transportation, logistics, and marketing. By learning how to use APIs such as Google Maps or OpenStreetMap to retrieve location data, you can build applications that provide location-based services to users.

Voice to Text Converter: Speech recognition is a rapidly growing field with many applications in areas such as virtual assistants, transcription, and language learning. By learning how to use speech recognition APIs or libraries to convert spoken words into text, you can build more natural and intuitive interfaces for your applications.
